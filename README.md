# 🥗 Fit Tracker

A modern and responsive diet and nutrition tracker built using **Vue 3 (Composition API)**, **TypeScript**, **Tailwind CSS**, **Pinia**, **Supabase**, and **Open Food Facts API**.

Fit Tracker emphasizes data accuracy, and seamless user experience. It features a sleek dashboard and an integration with the **Open Food Facts API** to help users monitor their daily intake and hit their health goals with precision.

This project showcases my ability to architect complex state-managed applications and integrate robust backend-as-a-service solutions.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔐 **Secure Auth**: Google OAuth and Email/Password authentication via **Supabase**.
- 🍎 **Smart Food Search**: Instant product lookup using the **Open Food Facts API**.
- 📈 **Goal Management**: Dynamic calorie and weight targeting logic.
- ⚡ **Global State**: Reactive and persistent data management with **Pinia**.
- 🎨 **Sleek UI**: Styled with **Tailwind CSS** for a utility-first, modern aesthetic.

## ✨ Implementation Highlights
